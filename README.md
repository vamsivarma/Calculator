Calculator
==========


=> This is my first iOS application. 

=> It basically contains a set of keys doing the basic operations of a calculator like addition, substraction, 
division and multiplication


=> This work out is done as part of CS193P, online course from Stanford University 
for building iPhone and iPad applications
